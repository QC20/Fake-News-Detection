# Fake News Detection on Twitter
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning framework developed for the detection of fake news posts on the online social media platform Twitter. We have conducted classification experiments on both an English and a Spanish dataset to achieve reliable results.

## Methodology
Our approach involved testing various methods and combinations to identify the best performing model for detecting fake news tweets. After careful evaluation, we found that the Gradient Boosting & Random Forest model, combined with features extracted from a TF-IDF approach, yielded the most accurate results.

## Results
For the English dataset, our model achieved an accuracy score of 75.33% mean accuracy in detecting fake news tweets. Similarly, for the Spanish dataset, we achieved a mean accuracy of 77.66%.
